Here is where I am going to be saving my data analysis projects with darey.io in 3mtt

### Mini Project: Data Cleaning and Analysis Task
### So, below are the instructions of the project. i will be sharing the before and after of the project.
Objective:
Your task is to clean and analyze the given dataset by following the instructions below. This exercise will help you practice data cleaning techniques and perform basic exploratory data analysis.

Instructions:

1. Remove Duplicate IDs – Ensure that each ID in the dataset is unique by identifying and removing any duplicate entries.
2. Handle Infinite Values – Identify and drop any rows where the Price Per Unit column contains "inf", as these values are not valid for analysis.
3. Regional Analysis – Calculate the total quantity sold and total value (Quantity × Price Per Unit) for each region. Present your findings in a structured summary.

Expected Deliverables:

A cleaned dataset with duplicate IDs removed and infinite values handled.
A summary table showing total quantity and total value per region.
A short report explaining your steps and insights from the cleaned data.

### THE METHOD OF CLEANING THAT I APPLIED
- I expanded the tining rows and colum
- Removing of Duplicate Ids- i made use of remove duplicate rebion on the data tab to remove duplicates of IDs
- i make use of find and replace to replace "inf" with "0"
- i made use of "= quantity * price per unit) to get the "total quantity sold and total value"
- i changed the data types
- then i put my data in a table in other to have a consistence and formarted table.
- lastly, i created pivot table to summarize the total quantity and total value per region.
